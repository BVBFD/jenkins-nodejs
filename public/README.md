# Lottery
<br>
This is the Lotter-Project that is able to pick numbers based on the recent actaul winning numbers rate.
<br>
I would buy lottery once a week, So, I would like to pick numbers based on the actual winning numbers rate.
<br>
That is why I made this SPA that is helpful for buying lottery.

While making this SPA, I implemented function that picks the numbers based on the won numbers before.
